[ ]  URGENT - combine flexible common and flexible lightbox? see if declarations are still up to date, and whether the youtube thing belongs in the photo gallery (I doubt it)
[ ] new flexible panel - full image
[ ] fix fields and buttons mess (Gravity Forms CSS, simplify)

[ ]  Easy way to add class to image that will make it a lightbox image? Might need to enqueue the lightbox script on all pages, not ideal...


[ ] better way to serve scaled images and backgrounds
[ ] new field: full width image only field
[ ] full screen mobile menu, simplify fade/mask


==========================
NOT URGENT

[ ]  Improve default icon font selection
[ ]  Look into SVG icons again
[ ]  on WebSavers, remove iThemes Security, and replace with direct tweaks to theme instead
   - /wordpress/ login URL? ask host support if useful.
   - ??
[ ]  On git, switch to less-autocompile when using git exclusively - see: http://michaelsoriano.com/working-with-less-atom-and-chrome-developer-tools/
