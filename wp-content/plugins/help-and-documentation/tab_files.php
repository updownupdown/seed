<h1>Files (Media Library)</h1>
<p>All the files you upload are stored on the server, and have an entry in the database. You can manage all your file uploads in the <strong>Media Library</strong> tab on the left.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Uploading Files</h2>
<p>You can upload files in batches through the Media Library and later place them in various pages or posts. If you do so, the files will not be <em>attached</em> to any page/post. You can also upload files while editing a page/post, in which case the file will be attached to that page/post. This is useful, since the Media Library lists which page/post every file is attached to (has been uploaded to), or if the file is <em>unattached</em>. You could then delete files that are no longer used by any page/post to clean up the Media Library and make room on your server.</p>

<p>To add files through the Media Library, click the <strong>Media</strong> tab on the left, then click 'Add New'. You can drag-and-drop files from your computer's file explorer, or click the <em>"Select Files"</em> button to use the file browser dialogue.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Adding Files to Pages/Posts</h2>
<p>It is usually more convenient to upload files while editing a page/post. When editing content in the content editor, place your cursor where you want the file link to appear and <strong>click the 'Add Media'</strong> button above the content editor.</p>

<p>You can upload a new file or select one from the Media Library. From the <strong>Upload Files</strong> section of the pop-up dialog, you can drag-and-drop files from your computer's file explorer, or click the <em>"Select Files"</em> button to use the file browser dialogue. You can upload multiple files at the same time.</p>

<p>After the file has finished uploading, <strong>you should edit the file details and select the display settings before inserting it into the page/post</strong> (see below for more details). Once that is done, click <span class="blue bold">Insert into page/post</span> to insert the file link where you specified earlier (cursor location).</p>

<p>You can also <strong>manually add the link to the file</strong>. To find out the file URL, click the "Add Media" button and find the file you are looking for. At the bottom right you will see the link to that file, which you can copy. From there, add a link to a text or an image in the content editor as you would a normal link, and use the file URL for the link (use the chain icon).</p>

<h3>Linking</h3>
<p class="bold">Before inserting the image in the content editor, make sure you select proper linking settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Attachment Page</em>: a near-empty page with a file link in the content area</li>	
	<li><em>Media File</em>: <strong>recommended</strong> this will link to the original file itself</li>	
</ul>
