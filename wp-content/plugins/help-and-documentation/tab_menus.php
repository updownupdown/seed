<p class="bold red">This feature is for advanced users only!</p>

<p class="red larger"><strong>WARNING:</strong> updating the navigation menu can break the styling of your website's header by making it too wide! You also cannot undo changes to the menu once you have saved them! If in doubt, leave these changes to the developer!</p>

<hr />

<p>You can manage the website's navigation menu by accessing the <strong>Menus</strong> screen under the <strong>Appearance tab</strong> on the left. If you do not see the 'Menus' link under 'Appearance', you probably do not have the necessary user permissions; ask your developer to change your user role.</p>

<p>Your website should have a menu already created for you called "Main Menu".</p>

<p>To add new pages to the menu, browse the pages list in the 'Pages' box until you find the page(s) you are looking for. Check the box next to the page(s) you want to add, and click the <strong>Add to Menu</strong> button. The pages will be added at the bottom of the menu structure on the right. Drag and drop the pages to change their order and hierarchy. You can nest pages to make sub-pages in the menu, but first make sure the front-end menu has the appropriate styling to handle sub-menus (it may only handle parent pages, or children pages, but not grand-children pages, etc.).</p>

<p>You can change the name of the page as it will appear in the menu by clicking the triangle next to the relevant page and changing its <strong>Navigation Label</strong>. You can remove a page from the menu by clicking on the same triangle and clicking the red <strong><span class="red">Remove link</span></strong>.</p>

<p>Click the <strong><span class="blue">Save Menu</span></strong> button to save the menu.</p>
