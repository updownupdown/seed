<h1>Adding or Editing a Product</h1>
<p>Whether you are adding or editing a product, you will be able to edit the same fields. Some fields may not be relevant to your product.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title:</strong> Located at the top of the page; this is the name of your product.</li>
	<li><strong>Full Description:</strong> Located below the title; this is the full product description and can contain additional images, links, headings, etc. The full description is only displayed when you are viewing an individual product page.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Data:</strong> This is where you set the pricing, taxes, sales, inventory, shipping options and more. Only set the options that are required, so the SKU and sales price may be optional.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom Fields:</strong> You can add custom fields to your product, however they will only be used if the product templates in the front-end make use of those fields. The exception is the 'total_sales' field which tracks the number of sales for that particular product. It is not shown in the front-end, but it is useful nonetheless.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Short Description:</strong> Similar to the long description, but without images or headings. It is meant to be used either in the products listing, or at the top of the individual product page.</li>
	<li><strong>Reviews:</strong> This section is used for product reviews, though that functionality may not be enabled on your website.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Categories:</strong> Located in the sidebar of the product screen, you can select which category(ies) the product falls under. You can also add new product categories from this box.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Tags:</strong> You can optionally tag your product with keywords. Located in the sidebar.</li>

</ul>
