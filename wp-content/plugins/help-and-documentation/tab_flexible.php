<h1>Flexible Content</h1>

<p>Some pages, posts, or custom post types use the "Flexible Content Sections" field. This field usually replaces the default content editor, and allows you to add several section types on top of regular content sections.</p>

<p>To use it, click the "Add Section" button and select the type of section you want. You can reorder the sections using drag and drop, and insert or remove additional sections using the 'plus' and 'minus' icons, visible once you hover over any of the sections.</p>
