<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Events are managed under the "Events" tab in the back-end.</p>

<h3>Adding and Editing Events</h3>
<p>Click on "Add Event" or click on an event in the event list to edit that event.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong>: Enter the event title at the top.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>: The main content area can be used to add all the event details, images, instructions, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Date/Time</strong>: You must enter the event date and time in the "When" box at the top right of the page. The event can span multiple days, and can be set to "All Day" if there are no specific start or end times.</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong>: Enter location details in the "Where" box to display a map of the event location. If you do not want to display a map, or the event does not have a specific location, check the "This event does not have a physical location" box.</li>
	<li><strong>Category</strong>: Optional</li>
	<li><strong>Bookings/Registration</strong>: If tickets can be purchased for this event, check the "Enable registration for this event" in the "Bookings/Registration" box. You will then need to specify ticket information for that event. Multiple tickets can be added; each ticket must have a name and price. You can specify the min or max number of ticket that can be purchased for this ticket type (leave empty by default). You can also specify the number of spaces available for that ticket type; the default is 14, so it is recommended to use a large number to avoid "fully booked" tickets (use 1000). You can also set the ticket availability dates, which is useful when there are early bird tickets at a lower price. After adding the tickets, you can also specific the total number of spaces (regardless of which type of tickets are sold), as well as the maximum spaces per booking (so that people can't buy 100 tickets in one go). Leave empty by default for no limit. Use the default booking form.</li>
	<li><strong>Excerpt</strong>: Optionally, enter an excerpt (short description) of the event, to be used in short event listings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Event Bookings</h3>
<p>To see a record of bookings, go to Events -> Bookings. <strong>By default, only bookings that need attention, and for future events, are displayed!</strong> Under "Recent Bookings" at the top, you can instead select "All events" and "All" instead of "Future Events" and "Needs attention" if you want to see the complete booking information. Recent transactions are also shown under "Transactions" at the bottom.</p>

<p>The Events plugin is setup to accept "Guest Bookings" meaning you do not need to be a logged in member to purchase tickets. If someone makes a booking when not logged in, some of the booking information will be made under a dummy user, "Guest Bookings". You can still see the real information under that particular booking.</p>
