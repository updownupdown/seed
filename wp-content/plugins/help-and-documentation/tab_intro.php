<h1>WordPress Basics</h1>

<h2>WordPress Dashboard</h2>

<p>Once you are logged in, the first thing you will see is the Dashboard. It shows you some statistics and information relevant to your website. Note the following points of interest:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User bar (top):</strong> The user bar has a link to the front-end of your website (top left), and a link to edit your profile as well as logout (top right). You generally do not need to use the user bar.</li>
	<li><strong>Sidebar (left):</strong> The sidebar lists links or tabs for each section of the back-end. The tabs shown will depend on your user permissions and your website's features.</li>	
	<li><strong>Screen Options (near top right):</strong> The 'Screen Options' button is shown on most pages throughout the back-end. It's a very handy way of showing/hiding certain boxes or columns depending on your preferences. For example, on the Dashboard you may want to hide the WordPress News and the Quick Draft boxes. When showing a list of Pages, you may want to remove the Author or Date column because they are not relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing Posts</h2>
<p>Virtually everything you're going to be doing in WordPress will involve different types of "posts": blog posts, pages (a special kind of posts), and "custom post types" (CPTs). CPTs may include staff bios, testimonials, resources, etc.</p>

<p>All post types are managed roughly the same way, so once you learn to edit a page, you will find it easy to edit a blog post, or a resource, etc. Each post type usually has its own tab in the sidebar. When you click on that tab, you will see a list of all the posts for the selected type. For blog posts, the list will look something like this:</p>

<div class="caption">
<img src="<?php echoImg('basics_lists.jpg'); ?>" width="600" height="316"/>
<p>A list of (blog) posts</p>
</div>

<p>Different post types will have different columns; pages may not have thumbnails, but bios might have them. Testimonials might have a testimonials excerpt column, etc. You can toggle columns on or off by using the "Screen Options" button at the top right. When you click on a single post, it will also has its own set of fields (title, content, date, featured image, etc.).</p>

<p>Also note the several ways in which you can search posts: filtering by date, by category, using the search box, or using the pagination for longer lists of posts.</p>

<h4>Adding, Editing, Deleting and Restoring Posts</h4>
<p>This functionality is similar for most post types.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>To add a post</strong>, find the "Add New" button at the top of the page or in the sidebar. Depending on the post type, it might say "Add New Page", "Add New Slide", etc.</li>
	<li><strong>To edit a post</strong>, click on its title, or hover it and click on the 'Edit' link.</li>
	<li><strong>To delete a post</strong>, hover on its title and click the 'Trash' link.</li>
	<li><strong>To restore a post</strong>, click on the 'Trash' link at the top of the page, find the post in the Trash, hover on its title and click the 'Restore' button. It will be returned to the main post list.</li>
	<li><strong>To delete a post permanently</strong>, go to the Trash again, but click on 'Delete permanently' instead. You can also empty the trash using the "Empty Trash" button.</li>
</ul>
