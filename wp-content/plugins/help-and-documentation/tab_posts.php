<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<p>In WordPress, each blog entry is called a <strong>"Post"</strong>. All posts have a <em>Title</em>, <em>Published Date</em>, <em>Content</em> (text, images, videos, etc.), and can be assigned one or multiple <em>Categories</em> and <em>Tags</em>. Some themes may confer special properties or options to blog posts not covered in this documentation.</p>

<p>This section assumes you are familiar with the WordPress basics section of this documentation.</p>

<p>To manage posts, start by clicking on the <strong>"Posts" tab</strong>.</p>

<h2>Previewing, Saving and Updating Posts</h2>
<p>You can <strong>preview your post before you save it</strong> to see what your changes look like using the "Preview Changes" button in the "Publish" box.</p>

<p>You can <strong>Publish or Save your post</strong> and make it 'live' but clicking on the "Publish" button in the "Publish" box. Once your post has been published, the button will now say "Save".</p>

<p>You can <strong>Unpublish your post</strong> by changing its visibility from 'Public' to 'Draft' under the "Publish" box. Draft posts will not be shown on the front-end of your website.</p>

<p>You can <strong>Delete your post</strong> by clicking the 'Move to Trash' button in the "Publish" box.</p>

<h2>Editing Posts</h2>

<h3>Title &amp; Permalink</h3>
<p>After adding a new post, write a Title for it at the top of the page. Once you save your post, WordPress will create a 'permalink' for that post, which is just a clean URL that usually includes the year and month. You can edit the permalink, but beware of creating conflicts with other posts with the same name. Permalinks should only use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The content of the post goes in the "content editor", the large text area with editing buttons (bold, italic, etc.) as well as the "Add Media" button.</em></p>

<h3>Excerpt</h3>
<p>By default, each post in a listing shows the first 100 or so characters of the post. It takes the full post content, strips away any formatting, and truncates the content after those 100 or so characters. You can bypass this function by using excerpts instead. In the post edit page, find the "Excerpt" box near the bottom of the page. If you do not see it, activate the box by toggling it in the "Screen Options" near the top right of the page (grey button). Make sure the excerpt is not too long, otherwise the post listing will be disproportionately tall!</p>

<h3>Post Thumbnail (Featured Image)</h3>	
<p>You can set a featured image for your post which will be displayed as a thumbnail in the posts list on the front-end. The featured image can be relatively small, depending on your theme. Use the <em>Featured Image</em> box on the right to select an image already uploaded to the Media Library, or to upload a new one. Once you have opened the 'Set Featured Image' pop-up, click the <span class="blue bold">Set featured image</span> button at the bottom right and click the "Update" button to save your post.</p>

<h3>Publishing Options</h3>
<p>You can customize the post's publishing date by clicking on the Edit link next to the date (in the Publish box on the right). You can date the post so that it appears to have been published in the past, or you can <strong>schedule a post</strong> to be published at a future date.</p>
<p>You can also save a post as a draft so that it is saved in the database, but does not appear on the front-end of the website. To do that, change the post status to <em>Draft</em> by clicking the Edit link next to the Status in the Publish box.</p>	

<h3>Post Revisions</h3>
<p>Every time you publish or update a post, a new revision is created in the database. If you ever want to go back to a previous version of a post, click the <strong>Browse</strong> link next to "Revisions" in the Publish box at the top right. You can select the revision you want and restore it, then update the post.</p>

<h3>Categories &amp; Tags</h3>
<p><strong>Categories</strong> are used to sort large numbers of posts into a few general topics which are then easily accessible in the sidebar of your blog. You can assign one or multiple categories to the current post, or create a new category in the <em>Categories</em> box on the right.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> are a list of keywords that represent the content of your post (as in Twitter's '#hashtags'). You can add tags in the <em>Tags</em> box on the right. Simply write your tags, separated by commas (e.g. "<em>lorem, ipsum, dolor sit amet, consectetuer</em>").</p>
